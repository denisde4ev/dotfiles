I'm the master of illusion<br>
Welcome to my mad delusion<br>
ref: /\^/\ https://github.com/denisde4ev/lyrics-to-type/blob/master/song-master-of-illusion#L7_L8 <br>


This directory exists because sometimes
<details open>
	<summary>the symlink must point to the repo</summary>
	<p>(
	and not to ".../user/repo/raw/master"<br>
	in order to be convinient link to the repo
	)</p>
</details>,
but acsessing files inside that folder
must come from master<details>
	<summary>or another branch</summary>
	<p>(
	oh another 4 nested dirs for every new branch 1 symlink for every repo.<br>
	I gotta make script for that..
	).</p>
</details>
