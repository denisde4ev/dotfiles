This directory exists because sometimes
<details open>
	<summary>the symlink must point to the repo</summary>
	<p>(
	and not to ".../user/repo/raw/master"<br>
	in order to be convinient link to the repo
	)</p>
</details>,
but acsessing files inside that folder
must come from master<details open>
	<summary>or another branch</summary>
	<p>(
	oh another 4 nested dirs for every new branch 1 symlink for every repo.<br>
	I gotta make script for that..
	).</p>
</details>
